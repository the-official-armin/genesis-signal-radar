* Finalized my promo video on Canva. I got so excited that I posted on YouTube right away. 
   * I realized that I also need to start considering “catchy titles” and the video’s thumbnail.

Hi y'all, wanted to ask and just kinda curious, what’s your process/flow to reach out to potential customers and gather user feedback? For example, I'm trying to validate an idea or understand more about a problem space and am curious what's the best way to go about this. Is it just cold outreach to potential folks on LinkedIn or do y'all have a better way of gathering that feedback?"

I’m a solo founder working on my first startup and I’m struggling mentally before launch. I keep worrying about whether it will ever generate revenue, even though the product isn’t finished yet. That fear is affecting my ability to focus day to day and actually make progress.

Working on validating a potential startup concept and would love this community's perspective.

The Problem: We know e-commerce site search is often clunky. Standard keyword search fails with synonyms, typos, and complex user needs. Data suggests this friction is a major driver of cart abandonment (seen stats like \~68% abandonment due to poor search) and lost revenue for online stores.
